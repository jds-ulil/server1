=== Transforming nginx for Windows ===

Note: Should you need support or report anything please use the nginx forums at
http://forum.nginx.org/ or post an issue at http://forums.ecsystems.nl/ or by email
support@ecsystems.nl (where we maintain the package builds)

Builds can be found here:
  http://nginx-win.ecsds.eu/
  Follow releases https://twitter.com/nginx4Windows

Todo:
- nginx-1.4.x_proxy_protocol_patch_v2.patch, looking into merging this one.
- pagespeed
- drizzle
- dynamic loading of add-ons
- ldap / ntlm
- allow multiple instances to run on the same machine
- installation and upgrade package
- investigate additional full 64bit builds

+ Additional custom 503 error handler via 513 (see onsite readme for example)
  Issue: a "return 503" can only be used once in a location block, when a custom 503
         is used for example with limit_req_zone you can't have a second custom 503
	 for a maintenance page
  example:
    server {
        listen  80;
        server_name  www.any.nl;
        root    '/webroot/www.any.nl';
        error_page 503 @floodnotice;
        error_page 513 @maintenance;
        location / {
            if (-f $document_root/maintenance_mode.html) { return 513; }
            # Or with a local IP check
            # set $maintmode S; if ($remote_addr ~ "^(10.10.*.*)$") { set $maintmode L; }
            # if (-f $document_root/maintenance_mode.html) { set $maintmode "${maintmode}M"; }
            # if ($maintmode = SM) { return 513; }
            # Yes we all know by now, ifisevil so put a sock in it
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            index  index.html index.htm;
            limit_req zone=floodh burst=32 nodelay;
            # generates a 503 when triggered
            # see limit_req_zone directive how limit_req works
        }
        location @floodnotice {
            root html
            rewrite ^(.*)$ /floodnotice.html break;
        }
        location @maintenance {
            rewrite ^(.*)$ /maintenance_mode.html break;
            # process a 513 but return a 503 to client !
        }
    }
  The normal behavior would be (if the file exists) to return the contents 
  of "/maintenance_mode.html" with a "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", or when the 503 error_page
  is used a 503, however a 503 is often used for other things, With this new 513
  error_page the same thing can be done but the 513 is replaced with a 503 when
  the headers are compiled which allows you to use the real 503 for other things
+ Select-boost: event driven, non-blocking API select() replacement, Beta

  conditions do not pass internal tests

Hello,

If you are following this thread (Transforming nginx for Windows):
http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,242426

Then this is the experimental binary you are looking for.

Compiled with:
FD_SETSIZE = 8192 (due to a recycle system in nginx you will be able to get
more than 16k concurrent connections with 4096 worker_connections, but feel free to
try out values all the way up to 8192)
This value has been compiled from scratch (original Windows source files modified
to accommodate a larger FD table)
